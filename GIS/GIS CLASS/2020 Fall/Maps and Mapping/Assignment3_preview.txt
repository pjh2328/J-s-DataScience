Assignment #3: Reference Mapping

Overview
For this mapping activity, you will use QGIS to create two high-quality reference maps: one showing countries within a region of your choice, and the others showing features within a country of your choice.  Through completing this mapping exercise, you will learn the following GIS mapping techniques:

Techniques for creating visually effective maps using multiple vector data layers;
Basic cartographic design techniques, including the essentials of figure ground, representation, color, and typography;
Vector data symbolization techniques, including color, labeling, and sizing;
How to use QGIS Layouts to create attractive print-ready maps containing common map elements, including titles, legends, scale bars, and other annotations.
Outcomes
You are responsible for creating two separate maps, which shall be submitted together in one PDF document (please export both maps at full resolution and join them together into a single PDF; do not insert images into a Word document.)

One of your maps must be rendered at the scale of a world region (e.g., Central America, Western Europe, Southeast Asia, etc.) and the following characteristics are required:

This map should contain three layers: country boundaries, rivers, and capital cities;
Countries should be visually differentiated by fill color, using one of the appropriate pre-defined attribute fields to ensure that no neighboring countries share the same fill color;
Countries should be labeled by name or abbreviation, and labels that are sub-optimally placed or missing using the QGIS automated label placement system should be manually adjusted or placed;
The other map be rendered at the scale of a country (e.g., Mexico, China, France, etc.) and the following characteristics are required:
This map should contain the following layers: country boundaries, rivers, urban areas, populated places, and capital cities;
Your selected country should be represented differently from all other visible countries in the interest of establishing appropriate figure ground and visual hierarchy;
Capital cities should be labeled by name, and rivers should be labeled by name using serif font labels that follow the curvature of the rivers;
The maps that you create with QGIS Layouts should:

Include layers represented with appropriate feature symbology;
Be exported from QGIS as a Letter-sized page layout containing basic map elements, including your name, a title, a neat line, a legend, a scale bar, and a written representative fraction scale (should be a clean, round number);
Reflect visual differentiation of oceans (use background color) and landmasses;
Include labeled vector layers as required (countries on one map; capital cities and rivers on the other);
Reflect use of map projections (coordinate reference systems) that are appropriate for the geographic areas you have selected.
Instructions

Begin by watching the videos for this unit on the QGIS Video Library page.  The videos provide a general walkthrough of the steps required to complete this activity for a region and a country of your choice.  Keep in mind that some data may not be available for areas outside North America and Europe.
